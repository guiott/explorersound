AInMux_0 has been substituted with AMUX4_mic to allow the switch through APIs of up to 4 inputs on Port_0_1/_03/_05/_07
The three microphones inputs are sequentially routed to PGA_pre used as a buffer performing a little amplification
The PGA_pre output is internally routed to BPF4_4KHz band pass filter to filter out all undesired signals with a little more amplification
The output of BPF4_4KHz goes to AnalogBus 1 and out to Port_0_5
Port_0_5 pin is internally connected also to AInMux_2 and routed to PGA_out for the final amplification.
PGA_out output is connected to AnalogOutBuf_2 and routed to Port_0_4. The filtered signal is therefore available on Port_0_4.
Port_0_4 is connect to Port_2_2 through a Schottky diode and a Capacitor in order to rectify the 4KHz signal. 
The DC signal out of the rectification circuit on Port_2_2 is routed to ADCINVR_mes to measure via SW the level of the input 4KHz signal.
The ADCINCVR_pot is used to read a pot, in order to manually (and optionally) set a threshold for the trigger part of the circuit.
Both ADCINCVR_ According to the formulas in the datasheet, performs a full measure in 1.7ms with a 4.8MHz clock (VC1) and 1 bit resolution
These parameters are choosen to have an high integration time that filters out undesired signals and because the reading cycle time is 10ms
A spreadsheet is available for calculation of parametere (ADCINVRcalc.xls)
performs 78 sps with 10 bit resolution and 320KHz clock (VC2)
The RefMux_1 is routed to AnalogOutBuf_3 in order to obtain an AGND virtual ground reference for the inputs. It is connected to them through a 1MOhm R
The SCBLOC_inbuff is used just as a buffer with a gain of 1 to connect the external Port_2_0 with ADCINCVR_Pot ADC.
TX clock derive from VC3 = 24MHz / 26 = 115384 * 8 bps = 0.16% error
TX module is connected to Port_1_0
The 16 bit heart beat timer HB_Tmr is the base clock for all of the timings in the program
its timing is: VC2 = VC1 / 15 = SysClk / 5 / 15 =  24MHz / 5 / 15 = 320KHz
	Timer Period = (1/VC2) * (PeriodRegister + 1) = 0.000003125 * (3199 + 1) = 10ms
For each 10ms timer cycle are executed 1 pot measure and 3 mes measures, each of this one last for 1.7ms for a total time of 5.1ms
