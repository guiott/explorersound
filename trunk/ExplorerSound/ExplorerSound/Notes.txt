AInMux_0 has been substituted with AMUX4_mic to allow the switch through APIs of up to 4 inputs on Port_0_1/_03/_05/_07
The three microphones inputs are sequentially routed to PGA_pre used as a buffer performing a little amplification
The PGA_pre output is internally routed to BPF4_4KHz band pass filter to filter out all undesired signals with a little more amplification
The output of BPF4_4KHz goes to AnalogBus 1 and out to Port_0_5
Port_0_5 pin is internally connected also to AInMux_2 and routed to PGA_out for the final amplification.
PGA_out output is connected to AnalogOutBuf_2 and routed to Port_0_4. The filtered signal is therefore available on Port_0_4.
Port_0_4 is connect to Port_2_2 through a Schottky diode and an RC low-pass filter in order to rectify the 4KHz signal. 
The DC signal out of the rectification circuit on Port_2_2 is routed to ADCINVR_mes to measure via SW the level of the input 4KHz signal.
According to the formulas in the datasheet, the ADCINVR_mes performs a bit more of 1000 sps with 10 bit resolution and 4.8MHz clock (VC1)
The RefMux_1 is routed to AnalogOutBuf_3 in order to obtain an AGND virtual ground reference for the inputs. It is connected to them through a 1MOhm R
The SCBLOC_inbuff is used just as a buffer with a gain of 1 to connect the external Port_2_0 with ADCINCVR_Pot ADC.
The ADCINCVR_pot is used to read a pot, in order to manually (and optionally) set a threshold for the trigger part of the circuit.
ADCINCVR_pot performs 78 sps with 10 bit resolution and 320KHz clock (VC2)
